# Advanced React + GraphQL

This is my work for the [Advanced React and GraphQL course](https://advancedreact.com/) by Wes Bos.

My final version of the project can be seen (here)[https://sickfits-frontend.now.sh].

# Sick Fits

Sick Fits is a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items. The application has five main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries. The app also includes many server side bits including JWT authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards. In addition to building both the frontend and backend of the application, we also spend the last ⅓ of the course Testing the React application.
